# EleNASystem

## Project Outline

**EleNA (Elevation-based navigation system)** is a navigation system that considers elevation gain when mapping out a route. EleNA allows users to discover a route between two points that maximizes or minimizes elevation gain while remaining within a user-inputed percentage of the length of the shortest path.
At a high level, EleNA takes start coordinates and goal coordinates (latitude and longitude), the maximum percent increase from shortest path length, and the mode (maximizing or minimizing) as inputs. EleNA then transforms this information into a visual representation of the best path.

## Running EleNA

Run the command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
